This week I've made a another swift pivot, but I've tried working faster this time, producing prototypes and a quick pseudo-code to accompany the images. 

I've decided to change the project idea again because it felt like the pollinate project wasn't meeting the brief exactly, and although I've enqired about my ideas through email they don't seem to have sent through. As I wasn't confident in my idea to go through with it I decided it was best to make a pivot towards something that I am more driven towards. 

I did some more quick brainstorming, but nothing too drastically different from the ideas I've made so far so as to save time. The ideas I've ultimately went with is:

The project is translating text into different emotions, each emotion adding on a new layer of effects to the image. I've tried thinking about how to combine the two things that I'm interested in in a new way, illustration and emotion. I've done drawing and illustrating elements that represent each emotion on previous projects before so I wanted to try something different in this project, perhaps something a little more experimental with the possibilities of the computer outside of traditional methods. 

a quick prototype or example:
