In week two we started jumping into processing. Getting familiarised with the program and playin around with shapes to begin with. 
The process was relatively easy at the beginning when we were following along with the process. 
When it came for us to do a little portrait of our own, it was exciting. I was learning a new tool that I can use to express myself creatively so it was really fun to just play around and see what creations we can pull out. It made me quite proud to see shapes coming together and turning out the way I intended it to.

Working with the shapes we learnt was not too difficult but I had some trouble trying to implement any movement so I didn't end up adding animations into the portrait. I was still happy with the way it turned out though. Perhaps I'll try adding animation and movement to it sometime after. 



I also had a look at some inspiration or websites that I found interesting :

- [Giorgia Lupi] (http://giorgialupi.com/)

Her work inspired me when I first saw it on Pentagram. She displays information and data in beatiful patterns and colours. I felt that despite bars and graphs providing more clarity, data relating to the human condition should be more expressive and reflective of the topic. Giorgia Lupi's work does a good job of displaying the data in an expressive way. 

- [Nikita Iziev] (https://nikitaiziev.com/)

Looking at designs produced through coding. Nikita Iziev's work is bold and creative desipite using mainly black and white in the designs. I was especially inspired by his daily experiments where he challenged himself "on the 2nd of February 2018 to create one post a day based on a keyword or phrase, in order to explore static/kinetic typography as thoroughly as possible." 

I found these challenges to be a very effective way to train and develop creative thinking. I also found it an impressive commitment to aim to produce something every day. The outcomes are beautiful and well thought-out.

- [Choir] (https://www.adultswim.com/etcetera/choir/) 

This is more of a fun one and a little strange but I loved using it to annoy my friends.
