During the first week we did a Dice rolling activity where we tried some "parametric drawing" in groups. 
By assigning elements to each number on the dice we formed some interesting images :

This activity helped me understand the use of parameters a bit better and allowed me to ease into the subject on the first day. 

I've never done any sort of coding before so starting off with an activity that I am more familiar with really helped me in settling into this studio, it was surprisingly fun and relatively easy to understand.
