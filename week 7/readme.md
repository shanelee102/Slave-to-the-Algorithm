This week has been a hectic week with a few turning points. After discussions about where the ideas should be by now in terms of it's development, steering into the prototyping stage, it's become increasingly clear that the ideas need to be solidified at this stage.
The ideas generated after the decision to pivot is made has been rough and early in its development. Not much background research was conducted yet and deciding where to move forward was difficult. 
I did eventually settle for the project that is essentially a web game and interactive art. It requires the player to navigate a map as a flower with other flowers or possibly players and avoid any pollen or pollinated flowers.
I made a paper prototype a GIF for what it might potentially look like :

And here is the accompanying pseudo-code:

IF pollen touch flower

  replace flower with pollinated flower
  
ELSE IF pollen touch player

  end game
  
END IF end game
  
IF pollinated flower touch flower
  
  replace flower with pollinated flower
  
ELSE IF pollinated flower touch player 
  
  end game
  
END IF end game
