This week everyone presented their pitches to the class. It was an insightful session full of creative ideas and intriguing discussions surrounding generative design. Seeing everyone's progress helped me better understand the ideas and types of projects that could be possible. 

Another interesting thing I picked up in this session was the amount of intersections of ideas. There were a lot of emotional mapping, data visualisation and exploration of the human condition. These are all topics that interest me as well and it was very interesting to see many people with the same questions in mind. 

My pitch was very speculative. It was about Sanctuary, a virtual space meant for therapy and relaxation. The thought of having a personal space catered to your emotions is a very intruguing concept for me.
The idea of spending time and doing everyday tasks in a virtual space is also an interesting question I wanted to explore. But as the idea utilises VR technology and emotional mapping, I found that it was too early for me to tackle with my current skillset.

That being said, it was a fun pitching session and I am glad I at least got this concept out for potential discussion. For further development, I've thought about using pre-existing data that people collected, and using that data to develop something that maybe speaks to the same ideas.

I'm very interested in exploring empathy, human emotion as well as visualisation and illustration. These are topics that I feel I am very drawn to but after hearing discussions and seeing everyone's work, I also don't want to feel like I am stuck within these boundaries I set for myself. so I'm looking forward to exploring more concepts to further develop my ideas.
