This week I began looking for ways to apply filters to images. I found a lot of interesting ways to manipulate an image through this site : https://medium.com/@delightful_Kdub/image-manipulation-with-processing3-c52ec08bbf27 

But as I am currently trying to work with P5.js, I began scouring for something similar for P5. 

I did a little experimenting on the P5.js web editor with the help of this site: https://codeburst.io/instagram-filters-with-javascript-p5-js-83f28c9f7fda
, experimenting with adding filters to video capture.

I started by changing the shapes of the pixels and their size. Then I moved on to experimenting with the colours.

This made me think of a lot of other possibilities using video capture along with speech to text. Perhaps it might look like you're having a conversation with yourself, watching yourself change colour or shape depending on what you say?
