This week I began looking for ways to apply filters to images. I found a lot of interesting ways to manipulate
an image through this site : https://medium.com/@delightful_Kdub/image-manipulation-with-processing3-c52ec08bbf27 

But as I am currently trying to work with P5.js, I began scouring for something similar for P5. 

I did a little experinmenting on P5.js web editor, experinmenting with adding filters to video capture.
