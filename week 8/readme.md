This week I've made a another swift pivot, but I've tried working faster this time, producing prototypes and a quick pseudo-code to accompany the images. 

I've decided to change the project idea again because it felt like the pollinate project wasn't meeting the brief exactly, and although I've enqired about my ideas through email they don't seem to have sent through. As I wasn't confident in my idea to go through with it I decided it was best to make a pivot towards something that I am more driven towards. 

I did some more quick brainstorming, but nothing too drastically different from the ideas I've made so far so as to save time. The ideas I've ultimately went with is:

The project is translating text into different emotions, each emotion adding on a new layer of effects to the image. I've tried thinking about how to combine the two things that I'm interested in in a new way, illustration and emotion. I've done drawing and illustrating elements that represent each emotion on previous projects before so I wanted to try something different in this project, perhaps something a little more experimental with the possibilities of the computer outside of traditional methods. 

a quick prototype or example:

and accompanying pseudo-code:

IF sad word

  unsaturate 
  
IF angry word
  
  motion blur 
  
IF happy word
  
  saturate
  
IF disgusted word
  
  subtract pixels
  
IF surprise
  
  distort
  
IF neutral 
  
  decrease all effects by 1%
  
This project seemed to fit the image I had in mind better than my last idea and I have a clearly direction of where I want to head into next. 

next steps: 

- Finding a sentiment analysis bot and testing it on processing.

- Finding templates of effects in processing

- Deciding whether or not I'm going to use text samples and illustrations on social media or magazines, or if I'm going to use my own text entries and accompanying illustrations for the project.

Week 8 class :

During class everyone shared where their projects have progressed and it was suggested to me that I keep the possibility for speech to text open. I am intrigued by the idea but am worried about how well I will be able to incorporate it. It'd be interesting to see the image distort as the speaker starts speaking to the image, as if its participating in a conversation, it is a direction that I think I want to explore more once I get more comfortabel with coding.
