In week two we started jumping into processing. Getting familiarised with the program and playin around with shapes to begin with. 
The process was relatively easy at the beginning when we were following along with the process. 
When it came for us to do a little portrait of our own, it was exciting. I was learning a new tool that I can use to express myself creatively so it was really fun to just play around and see what creations we can pull out. It made me quite proud to see shapes coming together and turning out the way I intended it to.

Working with the shapes we learnt was not too difficult but I had some trouble trying to implement any movement so I didn't end up adding animations into the portrait. I was still happy witht the way it turned out though. Perhaps I'll try adding animation and movement to it sometime after.
